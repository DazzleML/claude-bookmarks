## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Claude Code mod `convo-bookmarks`, from the proof of concept:
  - mark the mouse selection (or the latest prompt) with `Ctrl+X m <letter>`, jump back with `Ctrl+X ' <letter>`;
  - temporary in-place highlight of the marked line (coloured band, bold yellow words, `«a»` tag), cleared after 120 s or on the next prompt; display only, never written to the session file;
  - band line above the prompt showing the active mark's text;
  - probe commands used to verify the mod API: `/bm-ids`, `/bm-jump`, `/bm-pane`, `/bm-marks`, `/bm-sel`, `/bm-timeline`, `/bm-env`.
- Repo tooling: root `version.py`, `git-repokit-common` subtree, tests that keep `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` in step with `version.py`.
