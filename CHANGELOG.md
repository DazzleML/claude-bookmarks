# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- The version tripwire now checks a list of verified Claude Code builds (2.1.288, 2.1.289) instead of one, and its start-up toast and `/bm-env` report the plugin's own version, read from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, beside the running Claude Code version.
- README and platform support list Claude Code 2.1.289 as tested, alongside 2.1.288.
- `tsconfig.json` is now tracked (an exception to the template's `*config*.json` ignore rule), so contributors can run `tsc`.

### Removed

- The `/poc/` ignore entry: the root proof-of-concept copy is gone, preserved privately.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Claude Code mod `convo-bookmarks`, from the proof of concept:
  - mark the mouse selection (or the latest prompt) with `Ctrl+X m <letter>`, jump back with `Ctrl+X ' <letter>`;
  - temporary in-place highlight of the marked line (coloured band, bold yellow words, `«a»` tag), cleared after 120 s or on the next prompt; display only, never written to the session file;
  - band line above the prompt showing the active mark's text;
  - probe commands used to verify the mod API: `/bm-ids`, `/bm-jump`, `/bm-pane`, `/bm-marks`, `/bm-sel`, `/bm-timeline`, `/bm-env`.
- Repo tooling: root `version.py`, `git-repokit-common` subtree, tests that keep `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` in step with `version.py`.
